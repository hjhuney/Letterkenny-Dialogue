# Letterkenny-Dialogue

This is a project for natural language proocessing (NLP) exercises using the scripts from the Canadian TV show "Letterkenny." 

If you wish to contribute to this project by helping collect and format the scripts, please e-mail me at hjhuney at gmail dot com. 

Currently, we have collected scripts from 3 episodes, for 1383 lines of dialogue. 


## Scripts

The website Springfield! Springfield! currently has all the Letterkenny scripts, however, they are not in a format suitable for NLP currently. Major issues include lack of character identification, as well as multiples lines of dialogue being grouped together in one line. 

You can access those scripts below:
